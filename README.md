<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

1. **Create a Security Group**
   - In Azure, create a Security Group to house your virtual machines.

2. **Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine**
   - Set up a Windows 10 VM in Azure.
   - Navigate to the **Networking** tab and create a Virtual Network before clicking **Review + Create**.
   - Deploy the VM.

3. **Create a Linux 22.04 Virtual Machine**
   - Create a Linux 22.04 VM.
   - Ensure it uses the same Virtual Network as the Windows VM by selecting it in the **Networking** tab during setup.

4. **Connect to the Windows VM**
   - Obtain the **Public IP address** of the Windows VM from Azure.
   - Use **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** to connect to the VM.

5. **Install Wireshark on the Windows VM**
   - Log into the Windows VM.
   - Visit [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/#downloadLink) and download the appropriate version.
   - Install and open Wireshark.
   - Click the **blue fin icon** in the top-left to start monitoring traffic.

6. **Monitor ICMP Traffic**
   - In Wireshark, filter for **ICMP traffic**.
   - Retrieve the **Private IP address** of the Linux VM from Azure.
   - Open **Windows PowerShell** on the Windows VM and type:  
     ```bash
     ping [Linux Private IP Address]
     ```
     Example:  
     ```bash
     ping 10.0.0.4
     ```

7. **Continuous Ping**
   - In PowerShell, type:  
     ```bash
     ping [Linux Private IP Address] -t
     ```
     Example:  
     ```bash
     ping 10.0.0.5 -t
     ```

8. **Create a Rule to Block ICMP Traffic**
   - In Azure, go to the Linux VM's **Networking** section.
   - Under **Network Security Groups**, click **Inbound Security Rules** > **Add**.
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **Destination Port Ranges:** `*` (any port)
     - **Protocol:** `ICMPv4`
     - **Action:** Deny
     - **Priority:** 290
   - Click **Apply**.

9. **Verify and Remove the Rule**
   - Return to the Windows VM and verify the ping has stopped.
   - In Azure, delete the rule by clicking the trash icon.

10. **Monitor DHCP Traffic**
    - In Wireshark, filter for **DHCP traffic**.
    - In PowerShell on the Windows VM, type:  
      ```bash
      ipconfig /renew
      ```
    - Observe the traffic in Wireshark.

11. **Monitor SSH Traffic**
    - In Wireshark, filter for **SSH traffic**.
    - In PowerShell, type:  
      ```bash
      ssh [Linux VM Username]@[Linux Private IP Address]
      ```
      Example:  
      ```bash
      ssh labuser@10.0.0.5
      ```
    - Enter the password (it wonâ€™t display as you type).  
    - Once connected, type:  
      ```bash
      hostname
      ```
    - Observe the SSH traffic in Wireshark.

12. **Monitor RDP Traffic**
    - In Wireshark, filter for **RDP traffic**:  
      ```bash
      tcp.port==3389
      ```
    - Observe the continuous stream of RDP traffic.

</p>
<p>
go back to microsoft azure and click on the linux vm you created 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d929719-1a5e-4275-8d2d-1078c2858ae5" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
scroll down on the window that opens and copy the private IP address
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be51a9eb-28db-483c-9eac-7c78bfcbbfae" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
in the windows powershell you opened earlier type in ping the private ip address you got from the linux vm example ping 10.0.0.5
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09dee767-82d9-422b-8214-41fe36e44877" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
then minimize the powershell window and open wireshark if its not on the screen and see that the ping went through 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/843c574f-5a92-4e3f-a807-155dd20f3162" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to the windows powershell and type in ping linux private ip address and -t example ping 10.0.0.5 -t the -t flag just makes the ping to go on forever until it is stopped by a firewall or the user stops it 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b81a4c25-ae53-48f3-9d20-ba3a4cca7eba" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to microsoft azure and click on the linux virtual machine then click on networking, then network settings
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="!https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b64171a4-1e3f-4e3f-aa52-05aacc812c52" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
then click on network security settings 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19184f99-67da-4cd0-9a69-cfd09e0f525a" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
then click inbound security rules
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b060d1f7-d92d-4994-ac24-2f9237348f51" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
click add then go to destination port and add an astrick for protocol click icmpv4, action deny and for priority change it to 290 so it is the highest priority of the other rules and gets processed first and click add
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6466a15e-f5d2-466a-9ee9-87e8094f7e80" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to the wire shark on the vm and windows powershell and you will see the constant ping has stopped due to the firewall rule you have configured
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/641909e8-a9e7-42f1-86af-7654ff0ed009" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to where you created the rule and you can click the trash by the rule you created and it gets deleted
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/128a7fa6-0172-4eef-8c7e-ca898843c3b1" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
you can go back to windows powershell on the windows-vm and see the pinging started again
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49a6e435-dfd9-48d8-b445-cc89f4e2c3a0" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go to the windows powershell and type ipconfig /renew and all it does is it gets a new ip address 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079d5f80-5134-4eeb-a911-e05b31beacd6" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to wireshark and observe the DHCP traffic that ipconfig /renew created 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa4e0225-6ac9-48e2-8aec-4ce3e5dce218" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
in windows powershell type in ssh the username you choose for the windows virtual machine @ the private ip address example ssh labuser@10.0.0.5 and then type in yes to the question it asks you later, then type in the password you set for the virtual machine you wont be able to see it being typed but it is once your done typing click enter and you can type hostname to tell if you have successfully logged into the linux virtual machine
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9014c637-1266-4a4c-a7a6-74b604d9212f" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
go back to wireshark and see all the ssh traffic that was captured anytime you type a letter there is a new entry that is captured and if you try to inspect the traffic it is encrypted so you cant see but on telnet you can since it sends information in plaintext
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef26f587-4025-45df-be2b-68c09970a5c1" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
now type in where you filter traffic tcp.port==3389 and that is rdp traffic since RDP uses tcp ports and the port it uses is 3389
</p>
<br />
